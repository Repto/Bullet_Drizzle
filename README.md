Bullet_Drizzle
==============

Bullet Hell Game made With C# and XNA. First (Not Yet Failed) Project.

Movement:

The ships will automatically move towards the mouse when the game starts.

Firing: 

There are two firing modes that cannot be active at the same time. Holding the right mouse button will cause a bullet to be fired up and down. Holding the Left Mouse button will fire forward a fan of three bullets.

Powerups:

There are (as of now) 3 powerups: The S key activates the super-bullet, a fast-charging larger bullet that does more damage than a regular bullet. The D key activates a laser, that does 1 damage 60 times over 1 second in a line to the right of the player. It has a medium charge time. The W Key causes the player to fire bullets five times stronger than normal in two 180 degree arcs. It has a large time, and will almost always completely clear the screen of enemies.

Enemies:

So far there are 3 types of enemy. The Grunt is the basic enemy, with low health speed and firing rate. The Scout is a smaller, faster and faster firing version of the Grunt, but is extremely vulnerable, being destroyed by a single bullet. The Interceptor is a sturdier version of the grunt, but is only able to fire Up or Down.
